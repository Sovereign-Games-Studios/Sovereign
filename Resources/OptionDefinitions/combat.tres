Behaviour Nodes take into account the current state of the NPC and it's environment to determine what
action if any should be taken at the present moment. These are the \"branch nodes\" of the behaviour tree.

engage_enemies:
	This node determines if enemies in the NPC's vision range should be engaged or not. If they should, 
	this will progress to the leaf node of find_target.
