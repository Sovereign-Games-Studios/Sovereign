Actions directly modify the npc to set in motion events based on a series of considerations. 
These are the \"leaf nodes\" of the behaviour tree.

	Selects the best target from the list of npc's currently colliding with the NPC's vision radius. 
	Once best target is found, sets the target and initiates combat.
