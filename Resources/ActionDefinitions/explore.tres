Actions directly modify the npc to set in motion events based on a series of considerations. 
These are the \"leaf nodes\" of the behaviour tree. 

find_target:
	Selects the best target from the list of npc's currently colliding with the NPC's vision radius. 
	Once best target is found, sets the target and initiates combat.
